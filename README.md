Effective web search personalization can be of paramount importance for user
satisfaction and eventually web search engine's revenue. However, tracking users
to provide personalization intrudes their privacy, especially when users do not
voluntarily consent to it and provides biased web search results. In this work
we develop a Chrome browser extension in order to examine how short term
web search behavior affects web search results and we define metrics to quantify
personalization. Overall, we conclude that personalization due to web search
behavior is not immediate and bold, while interacting with web search results
does not contribute further to personalization.
